				<p> In 2020, The New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) published information they received from the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB), via a FOIL document, where they asked for all of the information in the NYPD Misconduct Complaint Database. Finally, in April 2021, the CCRB provided the NYCLU with supplemental data demonstrating the race and ethnicity of both the officers and the impacted person. 

				It found that 54% of the misconduct complaints filed were made against white police officers of all genders. This held true across the years 1997-2021. The highest percentage of people by race to be impacted were Black men at 30%. The second highest group were Latinx men. It was also found that more than half the officers accused were still active with the rest described as “retired” a categorization that needs more investigation. 
					
				Organizer and native Bushwick resident Ingrid Romeo stated that “Cops know what they’re doing when they harass black folks.”
